# Composable Commerce Postman Collections

Postman provides a REST client that helps you executing API requests without any development effort.
API requests can be organized into **collections** that you can import into Postman.

Theoretically, you can run the whole commerce journey from creating Customers and Products to creating Orders where these Customers purchase the Products.

Key benefits of using the Composable Commerce Postman Collections:

- Works with minimum technical knowledge with no coding required
- Can be used as soon as you have created a Project
- The API endpoints can be explored to achieve a holistic view of how Composable Commerce and other services operate

This repository contains Postman Collections including requests and responses for most Composable Commerce endpoints.
For each request, the smallest possible payload is given. Optional fields can be found in the related [official documentation](http://docs.commercetools.com/).

Additionally, the collections provide example requests and responses for specific tasks and more complex data models.
